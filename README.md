# Rational-Function-Analyzer
Program which analyzes rational functions based on their numerator and denominator. 

This program was made in TI-Basic on the TI-Nspire CX CAS II. It should work with a TI-NSPIRE CX CAS, but will not work with TI-NSPIRE CX or CX II. The computer algebra system is required.

The program has one command, asymp(). The user inputs the rational function's numerator and denominator seperately and is then outputted a total analysis of the function including vertical/horizontal/slant asymptotes as well as domains and intercepts.
